- in models, struct types are given "omitempty", but this is
  ineffective. must use pointer-to-struct.
- enum type names (e.g. VirtualMachineSizeTypes) should be made singular
- having to make multiple queries to get the state of a machine is not
  great. VM first, then network addresses. possible to include more
  information in the compute model?
- more thorough godoc would be helpful, if it's available in swagger
  or cross-referenceable
- I would prefer model struct fields were not anonymous types; this
  makes using struct literals impossible, which in turn makes code
  a bit more verbose.
