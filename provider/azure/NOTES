- Would be nice if network security rule priorities didn't have to
  be unique. We will be managing a single NSG for all machines within
  an environment due to NSG limits (100 per subscription), and so
  we create a new rule whenever a port is opened on a machine; they
  all effectively have the same priority, but we're forced to query
  the group and find the next availabile priority when allocating.

- Location seems to need spaces stripped: "WestUS" works, but "West US"
  does not. Could be an encoding issue in the Go SDK?
- It appears that the Go SDK does not automatically set the correct
  base URI for China locations. It would be nice not to impose on
  users the need to set the URI for standard Azure locations.
- VirtualMachine.Properties.StorageProfile does not have a field
  for specifying the image by name (equivalent to "--image-name" in
  the CLI's "azure vm create"). Juju uses image metadata published
  by Canonical to determine the image to provision, and this contains
  the image name; it does not contain the other information necessary
  to populate ImageReference. I can hard-code some of that for now,
  but it would be great if the image-name could be specified.

QUESTION FOR CANONICAL
- Is there any benefit to using simplestreams in the azure provider?
  we can just use image URN, Canonical:UbuntuServer:14.04.3-LTS:latest.
  * Pros:
      - we don't need to query the external streams data
      - we can do the same kind of mapping for CentOS and Windows
  * Cons: we need to list SKUs and select the best micro release (in this case, .3).
